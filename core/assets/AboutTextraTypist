{FASTER}TextraTypist is an advanced text rendering library created by Tommy Ettinger to be used with Scene2D. This enables the ability to mark text with font effects like [*]bold[*], [/]italics[/], and [_]underlining[_]. These are features sorely lacking from the official Label class. Now imagine that combined with the functionality of Rafa's {RAINBOW}TypingLabel{ENDRAINBOW}. Yes, you can have {WIND}amazing typing animations{ENDWIND} along with your text formatting!
TextraTypist Playground is a utility to help construct the markup necessary for rendering a TextraLabel or TypingLabel. Simply write text in the code textfield, then apply formatting to selected parts of the text by clicking the formatting buttons along the top. With every keystroke, you will see a live preview of the TypingLabel. Click the code "copy" button and paste it into your project. Make sure to check out the wiki for more details.
